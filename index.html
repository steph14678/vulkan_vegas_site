        <p>The online casino Vulkan Vegas will attrack you to their website by promising to give you $1000 just for signing up.  Does it sound too good to be true?  Well it is.  Kind of like when someone calls you to say that you won a cruise.  And even after you sign up and you put some money in your account and gamble it, they still show you in your account that you will eventully get your $1000, but trust me you will never get it.</p>

        <p>Also, if you put some money in your account and win some money by gambeling you will never be able to withdraw that money.  You can write to them that you want your money but they will never answer you.  Their strategy is obvious, they make you win a little bit of money expecting that you will gamble it hoping to win more and then they make you lose it so you had the impression that they are fair and it is your fault, that you should have withdraw that money after winning instead of gambleling it.  But if you try to withdraw the money you won they won't let you.</p>

        <p>This online casino even if it is called Vulkan Vegas is not american but Russian, which explains why they can get away with fraud.  The only way to stop them is to not fall in their trap and tell as many people as possible to avoid this online casino.</p>

          <p>I thought I was downloading a game about egypt trivia but Vulkan Vegas hijacked that download so when I was signing up for Vulkan Vegas I thought I was signin up for that app "Egypt Story I".</p>

          <p>I was attracted by the promess of $1000 like many and I never got it even after gambeling and losing a lot of money.  Also, they make the website confussing on purpose so that you never understand how to get that $1000 even if they show in under bonuses in your account.</p>

          <p>I put in $15 and won $163.80.  I decided to withdraw it, but I could not withdraw.  So I went in the support section of the website and chated with an employee. He told me that I could not withdraw because the $15 gave me a bonus and winning using a bonus could not be withdraw.  I argue a lot and he never accepted, he didn't even accept to at least give me back my $15.  Finally he told me to write to this email adress: "support@vulkanvegas.com", which I did, and many months later still no response. </p>
